## Introduction

`@canva/intents` is an npm package for Canva's [Apps SDK](https://www.canva.dev/docs/apps).
It provides intent-specific types and helpers that allow apps to integrate with specific surfaces within the Canva editor — such as the data connector panel or the design editor.

An "intent" represents a specific user workflow an app can support. For example:

- Users can select and import data from an app which implements the **Data Connector** intent.
- An app is able to present interactive and creative tooling alongside the Canva design surface by implementing the **Design Editor** intent.

The `@canva/intents` package encompasses **all available intents**, exporting each intent's type information and prepare function, grouped by domain.
This allows your app to prepare one or more intents while keeping each intent's implementation modular and type-safe.

Currently supported intents:

- [`Data Connector`](#data-connector-example)
- [`Design Editor`](#design-editor-example)

New intents will be added to this package in the future.

**Note:** To get up and running with the Apps SDK, check out [the quick start guide](https://www.canva.dev/docs/apps/quick-start).

## Installation

```bash
npm install @canva/intents
```

## Usage

### Preparing an intent

Each intent type has a corresponding `prepare` function in the `@canva/intents` package. You can implement any intent in your app code by calling the appropriate `prepare` function with the particular parameters it requires.

### Data Connector example

Here’s a full example of preparing a `data_connector` intent, which allows users to import tabular data from an app:

```ts
import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';
import { AppUiProvider } from '@canva/app-ui-kit';
import { prepareDataConnector } from '@canva/intents/data';
import { DataSelectionUI } from './data_selection_ui';
import { fetchData } from './fetch_data';

prepareDataConnector({
  getDataTable: async (request) => {
    try {
      const dataTable = await fetchData(request); // your data fetching logic here
      return {
        status: 'completed',
        dataTable,
      };
    } catch {
      return {
        status: 'app_error',
        message: 'Failed to fetch data',
      };
    }
  },

  renderSelectionUi: (request) => {
    const root = createRoot(document.getElementById('root') as Element);
    root.render(
      <AppUiProvider>
        <DataSelectionUI {...request} />
      </AppUiProvider>
    );
  },
});
```

### Design Editor example

```ts
import { prepareDesignEditor } from '@canva/intents/design';

prepareDesignEditor({
  render() {
    // render logic
  },
});
```
